        <strong>" 5  Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee"</strong>" </p>
          <p> Jeremaiah 1:7</p>
           <li> <p> </p></li><strong><p>Most times People tend to ask :who am I?</p></strong></li><p> Most probably I am likely to tell them I am Lily.Actually I am 
            Princess Lily.Just trying to make my name simple and accesible to everyone. But who does God say I am ?
            God being a loving father calls me his own daughter.In Actual sense, Jesus Christ is my Elder brother.
            I sound funny right?In actual sense I mean it . Well theres actually more to this.Ever wondered why I my opening 
            sentence was a scripture?I dont want to loose sight of the fact that I am not of my own,I am who God says I am.

                Just be real with me.I mostly make friends with people I have something in common with(I mean 
                two walk except they agree?).
                <p>It could be from school,classes,church,neighbourhood and many more places .</p>

             Just be real with me.I mostly I make friends with people I have something in common with(I mean 
             two walk except they agree?).Interestingly most of my friends are males through no fault of mine.

             <p><strong> MY spriritual Life</strong></p>
             <p>10 [For my determined purpose is] that I may know Him [that I may progressively become more deeply and intimately acquainted with Him, 
                 perceiving and recognizing and understanding the wonders of His Person more strongly
                  and more clearly], and that I may in that same way come to know the power
                   outflowing from His resurrection [[a]which it exerts over believers], and that
                    I may so share His sufferings as to be continually transformed [in spirit into
                     His likeness even] to His death, [in the hope]</p>
                     <p>Thats all I ask for not to be a church goer but to be deeply acquainted to the 
                         lover of my soul.Not just knowing about him but knowing his person.I dont say this to impress
                        anyone. Its a heart cry..... </p>


<p><strong>THE UNIVERSITY LIFE </strong> </p>
                       <p>Wow!I do not know where to even start from.I any case i have  alot to say.All I have to
                        say is that ,it has not been easy.NOT AT ALL.I got admission to study BSC.Information Technology
                        on the first of January 2022.It was all mixed feelings coming to the premiere University of Ghana.Not 
                        knowing what to expect.But I always take consolation in the fact that he has began a good work in me 
                        would bring to a perfect end.
